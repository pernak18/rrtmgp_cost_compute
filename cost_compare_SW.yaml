# COST FUNCTION DEFINITION (components, levels, weights)
# names, levels, and weights should be 1-1-1 mapping
# Eli SW cost function
components: 
  # id: [component name, [levels], weight]
  # component names should correspond to array names 
  # in the netCDF files (case sensitive!)
  # levels are lists of pressure levels to use in cost calculation
  # sfc: Surface, tpause: Tropopause, toa: top-of-atmosphere, 
  # all: all levels (implicitly a list); 0-offset index otherwise
